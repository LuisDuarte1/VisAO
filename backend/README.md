## About The Project

VisAO backend

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, you will need to install the prerequisites and follow the installation section.

### Prerequisites

This Project depends on the [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/).

1. Install poetry, via `homebrew` or [`pipx`](https://github.com/pypa/pipx):

   ```bash
   brew install poetry
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   pipx install poetry
   ```

2. Don't forget to use the python environment you set before and, if using `VScode`, apply it there.

3. It's optional, but we strongly recommend [`commitizen`](https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen), which follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
